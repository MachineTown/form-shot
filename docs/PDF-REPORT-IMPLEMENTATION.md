## Firestore Schema

### Collection: `report-configurations`
```javascript
{
  id: string,                          // Auto-generated
  customerId: string,                  // Customer identifier
  studyId: string,                     // Study identifier
  packageName: string,                 // Package name
  name: string,                        // Configuration name
  description: string,                 // Optional description
  formOrder: string[],                 // Ordered array of form IDs
  selectedLanguages: string[],         // Languages to generate
  includeMetadata: boolean,            // Include form metadata
  pageOrientation: 'portrait' | 'landscape',
  createdBy: string,                   // User email
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp,
  lastGeneratedAt: timestamp,
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'archived'
}
```

### Collection: `report-generation-jobs`
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  configurationId: string,             // Reference to configuration
  requestedBy: string,                 // User email
  requestedAt: timestamp,
  completedAt: timestamp,
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  languages: string[],                 // Languages being generated
  generatedFiles: {
    [language: string]: {
      url: string,                    // Signed download URL
      size: number,                   // File size in bytes
      pageCount: number                // Number of pages
    }
  },
  error: string                        // Error message if failed
}
```

## Security Considerations
- ✅ User authentication required
- ✅ Access restricted by customer/study ownership
- ✅ Rate limiting: 10 PDFs per hour per user
- ✅ Signed URLs with 24-hour expiration
- ✅ Audit logging for all operations

## Performance Targets
- Form list loading: < 1 second
- Drag-drop response: < 50ms
- PDF generation start: < 2 seconds
- PDF completion (20 forms): < 30 seconds
- Configuration save/load: < 500ms

## Success Metrics
- User adoption rate
- Average PDFs generated per week
- Configuration reuse percentage
- Error rate < 1%
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5

## Known Issues & Risks
- Large PDF files may exceed Cloud Function memory limits
- Browser memory constraints for preview functionality
- Network latency for screenshot fetching
- Concurrent generation requests may cause queuing

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing for UI interactions
- E2E testing for critical paths
- Load testing for PDF generation
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsive testing

## Documentation
- User guide for report generation
- API documentation for Cloud Functions
- Configuration schema documentation
- Troubleshooting guide

## Notes
- Implementation started: [Current Date]
- Target completion: TBD
- Primary developer: TBD
- Code review by: TBD
